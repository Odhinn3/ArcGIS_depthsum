This tool can be used for a calculating total drilling meterage on desired drilling profiles
It would be needed in planning any mapping drilling campaign, such as KGK, auger drilling etc.
You can input an expected average drillholes depth and a distance between planned drillholes at selected profiles
The result is output to the log file and as a message in ArcGIS geoprocessing tool window details
